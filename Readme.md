# Analysing POS data for Trends, Pricing and Menu changes

In this project, I analysed the point of sale transactional dataset to identify sales trends, suggest menu changes & impact of pricing changes.

## About the Data:
Data is collected from a caf√© run by business students at a Midwestern public university. The data were collected over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010.
